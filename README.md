VolatileVisions
This is a text-based Unity Engine game with basic RPG elements and a basic item system. 

~~~~~~~~~Installation~~~~~~~~~
Download the release file, extract, and run the executable file. 

~~~~~~~~~Controls~~~~~~~~~
The Main Menu is currently mouse based.
The remainder of the game is controlled via text entry. 
The parser will not recognize compound commands or verb-object commands such as "equip weapon"

At (almost) all times you have access to the following commands:
inventory 				: lists current inventory
equipment || equipped 	: lists current equipped items
equip					: enters equip menu (enter item name after executing equip command)	 
continue				: ignores current interaction and continues along path

Other contextual commands will be displayed on screen with the story text. 
Example: ">loot"
Note: You should not enter the > before your command. 
Example: "loot" is what you should enter as your command


During Battles you can Attack or Defend
Attacking will just trade attacks between the enemy and yourself.
Defending will block damage and grant an attack Bonus to your next attack.

Hint: Having an object that emits light equipped will affect available contextual commands or story events.
